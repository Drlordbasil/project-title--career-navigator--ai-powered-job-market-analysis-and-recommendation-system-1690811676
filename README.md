3. **Career Path Recommendation**: Based on the extracted data and NLP analysis, the script provides personalized career path recommendations. By considering users' existing skills, experience, and aspirations, it suggests optimal paths for career growth and development.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Applying sentiment analysis techniques to online forums and social media data related to specific industries or companies, the script gauges the overall sentiment and public perception. Users can use this analysis to assess potential employers or evaluate the desirability of specific career paths.

5. **Income Generation Channels**: The script explores non-conventional income generation opportunities in users' industries, such as freelance platforms, gig economy opportunities, or emerging job markets. Leveraging AI algorithms and scraping data from platforms, the script identifies potential income streams that align with users' skillsets.

6. **Smart Notifications**: The script periodically sends automated notifications to users, keeping them updated on industry trends, hot job markets, or new income generation opportunities. These notifications are customizable based on users' preferences and career goals.

7. **Visualizations and Reporting**: The script generates interactive visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly. Users can explore trends, compare industries, or track their own progress. Additionally, the script generates detailed reports summarizing key insights and recommendations.
